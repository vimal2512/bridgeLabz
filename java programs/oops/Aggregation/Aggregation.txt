// "Has-a" relationship (but with independence)

// Real-life:
// A Department has Professors

// If department is gone, professors still exist
// Key Point: Ownership exists, but lifetime is independent.


import java.util.List;

class Professor {
    String name;
}

class Department {
    // Aggregation: Professors belong to a department
    List<Professor> professors;
}


Aggregation is a "has-a" relationship, where one class contains a reference to another class, but the contained object can exist independently of the container.
It's a weaker form of composition
